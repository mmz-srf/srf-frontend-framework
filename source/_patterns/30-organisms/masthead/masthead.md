### Masthead
Multiple versions of the masthed are available:

#### masthead
this is the full-blown header intended for all landingpages except home.

this header can be themed. themes are based on css custom properties and their settings are defined in
_masthead-theme-settings.scss. for examples see
<a href="/patterns/30-organisms-masthead-demo-masthead-themes/30-organisms-masthead-demo-masthead-themes.html">demo page
masthead themes</a>. 

#### masthead--home
this header is only used on home. it has almost the same functionality as the compact masthead with one exception: on
smartphones, the portals are displayed as a scrollable subnavigation.


#### masthead--compact
this header is used everywhere else (i.e. in articles). this header should not to be branded.

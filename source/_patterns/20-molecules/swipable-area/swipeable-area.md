Config options:

You can optionally provide the swipeable area element with some data attributes:

* `data-tracking-forward`: Contains the parameters that will be directly added to the forward button to enable the tracking of interactions with it. Example content: `"event_source=My%20super%20Component&event_name=forward%20button"`.
* `data-tracking-back`: Contains the parameters that will be directly added to the back button to enable the tracking of interactions with it. Example content: `"event_source=My%20super%20Component&event_name=back%20button"`.

Literally all of these are optional and can be used independently of each other. How cool is that!

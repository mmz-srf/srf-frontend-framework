### Inline SVG of the SRF Logo
This inline SVG is the SRF-Logo (48*32).

It must be included once on a page (in this framework it's done in `source/_meta/_00-head.twig`).

Afterwards, you can use it everywhere on the page with `<use xlink:href="#srf-logo" />` and scale it with css transform. Enjoy.

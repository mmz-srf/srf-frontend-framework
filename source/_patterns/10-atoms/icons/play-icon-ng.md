### play-icon-ng
Play icons must be placed in a square container since their dimension is defined by width 100% and height 100%.

#### Note:
the suffix "-ng" in the atom's name stands for "next-generation" and was added for backwards compatibility.
please remove the _old_ play-icon and rename this atom to "play-icon" when the refactoring of the media elements
to the new "medium" molecule is done.

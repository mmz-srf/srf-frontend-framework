### play-icon-ng
Play icons must be placed in a container which defines their dimensions since their width and height are set to 100% (with a restriction to a 1:1 ratio).
#### Note:
the suffix "-ng" in the atom's name stands for "next-generation" and was added since the name without suffix was already in use.

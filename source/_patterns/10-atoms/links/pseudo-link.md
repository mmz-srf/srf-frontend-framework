### pseudo-link
**important: links should always use the default &lt;a&gt;-tag. use this atom in very special occasions only.**

*example for such a special use case:*

related-episodes need a link within a wrapping &lt;a&gt;-tag. since &lt;a&gt;-tag cannot be nested,
this atom is used as a workaround with a javascript handling the link functionality.
